/// If a file has a long file name, the complete name appears in the cFileName member, and the 8.3 format truncated version
/// of the name appears in the <see cref="cAlternateFileName"/>member. Otherwise,<see cref="cAlternateFileName"/> is empty. If the FindFirstFileEx function
/// was called with a value of FindExInfoBasic in the fInfoLevelId parameter, the <see cref="cAlternateFileName"/> member will always contain
/// a NULL string value. This remains true for all subsequent calls to the FindNextFile function. As an alternative method of
/// retrieving the 8.3 format version of a file name, you can use the GetShortPathName function. For more information about
/// file names, see <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247(v=vs.85).aspx">Naming Files, Paths, and Namespaces (MSDN)</a>.
