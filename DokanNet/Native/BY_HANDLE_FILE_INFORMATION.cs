/// <remarks>
/// The identifier that is stored in the nFileIndexHigh and nFileIndexLow members is called the file ID.
/// Support for file IDs is file system-specific. File IDs are not guaranteed to be unique over time,
/// because file systems are free to reuse them. In some cases, the file ID for a file can change over time.
/// 
/// In the FAT file system, the file ID is generated from the first cluster of the containing directory
/// and the byte offset within the directory of the entry for the file. Some defragmentation products
/// change this byte offset. (Windows in-box defragmentation does not.) Thus, a FAT file ID can change
/// over time.Renaming a file in the FAT file system can also change the file ID, but only if the new
/// file name is longer than the old one.
/// 
/// In the NTFS file system, a file keeps the same file ID until it is deleted. You can replace one file
/// with another file without changing the file ID by using the ReplaceFile function. However, the file ID
/// of the replacement file, not the replaced file, is retained as the file ID of the resulting file.
/// 
/// Not all file systems can record creation and last access time, and not all file systems record them
/// in the same manner. For example, on a Windows FAT file system, create time has a resolution of
/// 10 milliseconds, write time has a resolution of 2 seconds, and access time has a resolution of
/// 1 day (the access date). On the NTFS file system, access time has a resolution of 1 hour.
